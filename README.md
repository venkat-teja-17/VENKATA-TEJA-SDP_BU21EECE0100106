A printed circuit board (PCB) is a structure that assembles electronic components and their connections into a unified circuit. It allows for electrical connections between components and provides mechanical support for the components. PCBs are built using alternating layers of conductive copper and insulating material. The conductive features include copper traces, pads, and planes, while the insulating material is typically a rigid or flexible substrate. The overall structure is plated and covered with a non-conductive solder mask, and a silkscreen is applied to provide a legend for the components.

PCBs can be single-layer, double-layer, or multilayer, with the number of layers determining the complexity and density of the board. They are used in various electronic devices, from simple appliances to complex computer hardware and advanced semiconductors.

PCBs are designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software, which helps ensure that the board meets specific performance, reliability, and signal integrity requirements. The design process involves creating a schematic, laying out the components, and ensuring that the board can be manufactured and assembled efficiently.


PCBs are made from a variety of materials, including copper, silicon, and other insulating materials. They can be custom-designed to meet project needs, offering greater control over the circuit layout and appearance.

The comprehensive PCB workshop conducted at GITAM University focused on analog and digital circuit design, developing and simulating low-pass filters and half-adder circuits using Tinkercad and EasyEDA. This enhanced skills in PCB design, embedded systems, and sustainable energy solutions, aligning with the key aspects of PCB design and fabrication.

## Workshop Projects

During the comprehensive PCB workshop conducted at GITAM University, I worked on several projects focusing on analog and digital circuit design. These projects enhanced my skills in PCB design, embedded systems, and sustainable energy solutions. The projects completed include:

- [555TIMER](https://github.com/venkat-teja-17/PCB-WORKSHOP/tree/main/555TIMER)
- [8-BIT COUNTER](https://github.com/venkat-teja-17/PCB-WORKSHOP/tree/main/8-BIT%20COUNTER)
- [HALF ADDER](https://github.com/venkat-teja-17/PCB-WORKSHOP/tree/main/HALF%20ADDER)
- [LED BLINKING ON AND OFF](https://github.com/venkat-teja-17/PCB-WORKSHOP/tree/main/LED%20BLINKING%20ON%20AND%20OFF)
- [POLICE LIGHTS PROJECT](https://github.com/venkat-teja-17/PCB-WORKSHOP/tree/main/POLICE%20LIGHTS%20PROJECT)

Each project involved designing and simulating circuits using tools like Tinkercad and EasyEDA, reinforcing fundamental concepts in circuit design and implementation.
